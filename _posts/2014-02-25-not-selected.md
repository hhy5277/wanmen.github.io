#Wanmen not on the list

Unfortunately, wanmen was not on the Google Summer of Code mentoring organization list. We will need to work harder to better prepare ourselves as a strong open source community. 

In the meanwhile, we hope students find our projects interesting and willing to join us as tech volunteers to execute some ideas. 

Our vision is to make a great impact to the future of higher education. Let's come together to make a difference.

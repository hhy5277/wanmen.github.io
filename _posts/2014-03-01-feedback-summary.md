Carol gave some feedbacks on our idea page. Basically, there are some problems our applications.

##Comments to the previous group, which apply to our group as well.

alright, so, firstly, i like your ideas page, but it could have used some more flesh on the ideas

i don't mind that it's short, but if it's going to be short, it's got to be well-described for each idea

your app actually looks fine, but i would have been more swayed if you had someone vouching for you

but the ideas page wasn't as convincing as it needed to be


##Comments to our group.

so, i have similar feedback for you that i did for the last group

i don't mind that your ideas page is short, but if it's going to be short it's got to be really well-fleshed-out

some of your ideas have skills required and languages, others dont

you don't necessarily need to add more ideas, but you do need to describe each one very well if you choose to go that route

it sounds like an interesting project, but we would have also liked to see someone vouch for you

that would have been a nice point in your favor

##总结一下，以下几点：

1. Idea稍微多一点
2. 每一个Idea写得尽量详细和统一，比如有些写了需要用哪些语言，有些却没写
3. 最好有人推荐
